# Music Recommendation for group settings

NOTE - This an academic project, not intended for real world usage, the repository doesn't throw back the list of recommended songs (although it can be modified to do so) but rather serves the difference (cosine) between the input blend and the input playlist(s)

## Abstract
Recommendation engines have been on the rise since the early 2000’s, however the current literature focuses majorly on the recommendations provided to a single person for any given system. Humans, being social creatures, often find themselves in a social setting where people with heterogeneous tastes come together. Our goal here is to generate music recommendations such that they cater to everyone’s interests, providing a playlist that everyone can enjoy

## Setup

- Add your spotify token to .env
