# Music Recommendation for group settings


## Abstract
Recommendation engines have been on the rise since the early 2000’s, however the current literature focuses majorly on the recommendations provided to a single person for any given system. Humans, being social creatures, often find themselves in a social setting where people with heterogeneous tastes come together. Our goal here is to generate music recommendations such that they cater to everyone’s interests, providing a playlist that everyone can enjoy
